This is an Assignment from Refocus.

The goal if this assignment is to Create a to-do list with functionalities to check completed tasks or delete them.
To accomplish this, create an array of objects and dynamically use and display
them in JSX. This task will help you become familiar with dynamic values and
props in functional components.

I add additional functionalities to this assignment like can add to-do list and search onto the to-do list.

I already uploaded it to the live server.
